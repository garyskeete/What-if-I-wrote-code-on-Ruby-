So the aspect of epigenetic's the Crispr  cas9 system and the application to reverse engineer and reverse sequence diseases through gene editing the aspect of teleportation in time travel with that aspect of reversing the time signature to make up for lost time due to previous illness be aspect of time signatures on a photonic level affecting a crystal that can reverse the effects of a manifestation a malignancy a metastasis a tumor formation an illness a disease medical application see he Casimir effect

The aspects of the Casimir effect being used to regulate and reverse apoptosis and injury on cells the effect of cellular reversal of cancerous tumors the effect of cellular history being reversed due to the Casimir effect and this effect on genetics

 Determination of finding the correct sequence of events for the liberation of materials in 3-D matrix situations for the proliferation of quantum entanglement quantum computing quantum relays due to time travel due to curing cancer  due to situations of management and control of quantum Computation in computational neuroscience and epigenetics

 Overall Intrinsic approach the likelihood of cellular differentiation cellular control and management of magnetic supreme for articles that are intrinsic to Realization of supramolecular structures in the design of genetics the design of cells in the design of DNA in Cellular and molecular collaborations of the overall aspect of health  within a genetic network for epigenetic's computational neuroscience

Utilizing nanotechnology frameworks for the polymerization by self assembly and structures of regenerative biology with stem cells see project on Educreations Biofilm reinvented of the aspect of the Casimir effect to reverse apoptosis to reverse cell damage to reverse metastasis malignancy tumours mutations

The collaboration and configuration of all known details to cooperate to form a notion of competency in the aspect of cancer research cancer alteration of the aspect of look at  brain  surgery non invasive for cancer glioblastoma Altzheimers mental illness and disorders disease and illnesses the difference between states of mind and  states of matter the opposing frontal lobe's aligning entangled qubits photons

The application to scaffolds to rebuilding to self-assembly through polymerization the aspect of building cell stem cell's building reproductive cells rebuilding genetics and composing carbon connections bases DNA structures of composite cells the construction of regenerative biology the aspect of regrowth of natural aspect of cells through methods of reproduction and synthesis in minimally invasive surgeries

 So imagine if the next hospital being built was mechanized automated in a way where there was an assembly line where gurneys and beds could be appropriated for the hospital use in regimented fashion to go along assembly line which led to the hospital in a regulatory fashion delegating the beds automatically by mechanize control to certain rooms on a magnetic strip  The hospital completely automated Fully robotic surgeries MRIs etc then apply should techniques of feeding nutrition and soothing music and lights for appropriate rest situational control of robotics and medication dispensation would be done in tune with the aspect of the hospitalization would be routes of departure for the beds  The patients to be discharged after time upon exiting the hospital after a duration of time has elapsed determined by their treatment regime patient's family are informed caregivers are informed went to pick up the patient in a thoroughly automated sense of detection of disease type treatment  And discharge
