Utilizing ice sonics frequencies radio waves radiology utilizing sonar and echolocation frequencies photonics the scaffold building of new tissue networks and matter within the brain by minimally invasive injections of stem cells to adjust to techniques of regenerative biology to realign and regain repair and eventually reanimate new processes of axons Purkinje fibres etcetera
Radiating through the brain networks a 3dimensional model of the inner processes of the brain comes to light with the photonics travelling along the dendrites and into various networking sites to affect the functionality and with that the maintenance of consistency with magnetism and the healing effect that goes with that also the effect of the tuned in pitch to regulate activities mathematically in signalling and communication multi pitch multi frequency adaptations to exacting details needed for correct brain activity for healing effect
