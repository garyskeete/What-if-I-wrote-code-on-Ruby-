Adaptation of spectral equipment to coincide and predict to instil to follow to trace where a spectral image is travelling where is spectral image as transferred it's Destination destiny or it's traceability to another realm or destination or dimension this could be traced through string theory mechanisms the multi dimension theory and the allocation of quantum computing with quantum cryptography qubits being placed within the spectral image to trace its measurements locale and feasibility.
The combination of events to measure heat cold temperature atlas there whether not oxygen is present whether not as life supporting attributes whether or not it's practical in particle format or in  solid liquid or gas and the adaptation of elemental design the adaptation of new elements being formed and found Evaluation of a new way of supported lifestyle through suspended animation through supportive life systems through photographic medium through analysis of quantum effect on laser trajectory the placement of qubits anywhere in the universe to compensate for quantum computation entanglement and teleportation the effect on computational neuroscience.Life-support systems for brain integration of computational neuroscience for allocation of systems of repair regeneration and reanimation the systematic control over noninvasive surgeries of tumours dissolving and righting the genetics involved in the tumour production the association with blood vessels and the reversal of affects of using stem cells for the prevention of cellular apoptosis the integration with systems of anatomy
The integration with artificial intelligence the allocation being the decision to allow the artificial intelligence to interplay with holographic sequences to create the quick scenario for life support add suspended animation to do with non-invasive surgeries and integrate with the partaker to create the correct scenario for holographic sequences to heal thrive and grow and for the noninvasive surgeries which support repair and reanimate sequences in the DNA RNA and genetics through CRISPER and Epigenetic's through möbius applications the self assembly of polymerization speeded up to enhance repair and reanimation leading to healing and resuscitation
